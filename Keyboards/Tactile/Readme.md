# Full QWERTY Matrix Keyboard using Tactile Keys
In 40 years, neither the TEC-1 nor any clones ever had a full qwerty keyboard as an option but with the
advent of the TEC-1G, now you can have a full keyboard while still preserving the ability to 
interact with the default Monitor 3.

Coming SoonÂ®  (But it isn't difficult to work out.)

## The Problem with Tactile Keys, and a Clever Solution
You know you have made a successful open platform when users other than yourself start making things for it.
Better still, if they start solving problems and release their solutions to the wider community!
That is exactly what Charlie Syms of the Facebook Group (join us!)[https://www.facebook.com/groups/tec1z80] has
done with the release of hi keyboard frame.

See the problem with Tactile Keys (well, the cheap ones. See below) is that they are rather "sloppy" in that
they allow twisting of the centre shaft that the keycap gets attached to. That allow for the keybaord to
end up looking like THIS in a short space of time. Now if anyone knows me, you would know that just LOOKING
at this picture makes my face twitch and my brain hurt.

Thankfully, Charles has come up with a genius solution and is kind enough to share his design with the broader community.
Your keyboard ends up looking like this. Much better! I'm going to print mine with some black PLA to make the contrast between the keys
really pop! I'll share pics in the FB forum. Thanks, Charles!!

## Better 12mm Tactiles
It's been brought up in the Facie Forum that there is a good brand of the 12mm tactile that DOESN'T allow for
spinning of the centre shaft. That is OMRON and they have a white shaft that has a slightly lesser contact force to activate the switch.
This makes them even easier to use! That doesn't mean I won't be printing up a "Matrix Frame" in black to make it look slick!
