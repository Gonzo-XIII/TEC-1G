## 3. The Power Delivery Circuit

This may seem too short a section to write up separately, but this is one of the most crucial parts of the build.

As with any building (the real ones we live in), if you don't have a solid foundation that you can rely on and be 100% certain is the bedrock of your build, so it is the same with a proper power circult that is tested to work and deliveres power correctly to where it needs to go and not where it shouldn't.

### The 7805 Regulator
The TEC-1G, as with most other Z80 machines of the time works on a single 5v power supply. We could get a power pack and feed 5v directly into system, but those are not always easy to come by and instead you might find you have a 9v pack instead. Hence, since the first days of the TEC-1, they have had a 5v regulator by means of the 7805:
