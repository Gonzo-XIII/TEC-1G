# TEC-Expander Legacy Adapter

Have some old TEC-1 expansion boards (like the Speech Board) you want to attach to your 100% backward-compatible TEC-1G,
but it seems to be missing that daggy old expansion socket or is covered by a TEC-Deck Card?

Then you need the amazing TEC-Expander Legacy Adapter, designed by Ian McLean!
