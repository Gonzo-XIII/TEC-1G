## 7 Segment Bezel by "Fred Nichols" (3/May/2024)

Now this is really cool! Fred Nichols has created a 3D printable Bezel that sits over the 7 segment displays. He has kindly released the STL files so you can download it and print it yourself or get a shop to do that for you. Either way, it makes the TEC-1G look really fancy!

## Dedicated TEC-1G Video Channel Launched (27/Apr/2024)
Yes, we know the documentation isn't complete, and even if it were, there are many amongst us that don't do well learning anything by reading text on a screen. Some of us (raises hand) are visual learners and so videos work well for seeing how things are put together.

And that is exactly what the channel will be about. We will announce new upcoming products, have demos of peripherals available for the TEC-1G, highlight any really cool code released by you, the users, and have documentary type videos showing exactly how any board is put together.

We look forward to your feedback and let us know what you would like to see.
