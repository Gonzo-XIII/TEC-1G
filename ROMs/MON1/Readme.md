# MON-1B for the TEC-1G

Completely original. All that has been done is pad the Binary image out to 16K (for ease of use in a TEC-1G) and place version markers right at the end.

## The Original

MON-1 is the original monitor ROM for the TEC-1 It was written by John Hardy.   

MON-1 comes with routines to control the 6 digit 7-segment display of the TEC-1 as well as the speaker and the hexadecimal keypad. It also contains a welcome message from the author, two tunes: Bealach An Doirín and Biking up the Strand and three games: Invaders, Lunar Lander and 23 Matches (incorrectly titled Nim in the magazine). 

The code was written by hand and compiled without the aid of an assembler. It was then burned to an the EPROM and was then dropped into the TEC-1 prototype for testing. This process was repeated many, many times until all the code was fully tested and found to be working correctly.  

MON-1 was developed in late 1982 and released along with Issue 10 of Talking Electronics magazine in February 1983.

MON-1B is the third version of the ROM and removed some redundant some routines present in MON-1 and MON-1A.

### Mark's Note
MON-1 was the **first** "operating system" I had ever experienced on any computer, as the TEC-1 was my **first** computer,
and introduced me into the world of computing.  I truly believe there is, even to this day,
**no better way** to understand how computers ACTUALLY work at the hardware level, than to build and program a TEC-1.

I believe that learning about computers, at this fundamental level, should be taught to every high school student.

From the bottom of my heart, I thank John Hardy and Ken Stone for their efforts and bringing the TEC-1 into my life.
