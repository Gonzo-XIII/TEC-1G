# TEC-1G Connectors

This is a list of TEC-1G expansion port connectors and their respective pin-outs.

A note on PCB connector orientation markings. Pin one is identified as the pin that is not within the solid connector outline on the silkscreen, but instead has a small L on one corner, or is individually outlined. Pin 1 also has a square solder pad, the other pins are round.

## J1 - Z80 Bus Vertical Connector

Follows the Z80 CPU pinout i.e. pin 1 - A11, pin 2 - A12, etc.

## J2 - Z80 Bus Horizontal Connector

Follows the Z80 CPU pinout i.e. pin 1 - A11, pin 2 - A12, etc.

## J3 - TEC Expander

## J4 - MATRIX Keyboard

## J5 - FTDI
FTDI offers two options - with the pins left-to-right and right-to-left. This is because there are two common types of FTDI module - fit the connector that suits your type of FDI module. Pin orientations are clearly maked on the PCB silkscreen.
