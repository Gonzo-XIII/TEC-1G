# Cases, Enclosures and Stands

Sick of having you TEC-1G lying on the cold hard bench, with all your tools and parts shorting the underside?

Want to display your beautiful TEC-1G in the best light possible so your friends and family will go "Ooh" and "Ahh" at your cleverness?

Have a 3D printer that has you wondering what you can do with it?

Question no more and pick your favourite design blow, download the STL file and elevate your TEC-1G to the height it deserves!
