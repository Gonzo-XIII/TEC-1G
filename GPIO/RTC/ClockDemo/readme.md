# Simple Clock Demo

A basic example of working with the DS1302 RTC chip to display a simple clock on the 7-seg displays and also the LCD.

The clock is reset to 12:00.00 PM each time the program restarts.

This simple demonstration program doesn't allow the clock to be set while running, nor does it display the calendar (date or year). These functions could be added as an exercise in extending the program.
