# Micro SD Card Support for TEC-1G

## ERRATA
The first print (Green v1.0) and second print (Blue v1.1) of the GPIO SD-Card board had errors
regarding the Disc Activity LED. The resistor should be tied to +5V, not to GND.

The best way to fix this is to mount the 330 Ohm resistor on the *underside* of the PCB.
Insert the upper leg (closest to the LED) as normal but from the underside. And the other
leg of the resistor should be soldered to Pin 20 of the 74HCT273, which is +5V.
